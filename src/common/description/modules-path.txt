Path to the file where modules and/or paths to other CircleCI configs that will be joined are declared.
Defaults to /tmp/modules.txt even if not set.

Entries in this file can be in form of module name or full path to the config file.
If module name is used, module must have `.circleci/config.yml` present.
If full path is specified - the file name must end in `config.yml`
If one needs to include a config file from the root `.circleci` directory - full path must be specified.
Valid `modules.txt` file may look as follows:
```
module1
module2/
module3/.circleci/config.yml
module3/.circleci/custom-config.yml
.circleci/common-config.yml
```
