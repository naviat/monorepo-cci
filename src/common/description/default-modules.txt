A comma-separated list of default modules that will always be added to the << modules-path >>.
Each module must have `.circleci/config.yml` in it.
Specifying the full paths from repository root to config files is also allowed.
If a path to a custom config yaml file is specified - it must end in `config.yml`
Example: `module1,.circleci/custom-config.yml,/path/to/custom-config.yml`
